# Minimal Presentation Template in Beamer

This repository contains a minimal template for creating presentations using the Beamer package in LaTeX. The present logo is for NIT Surat (SVNIT). You can add any logo of your own in the `logos` folder and renaming it to `logo.png`.

You can also alter the color themes by making edits in the `beamercolorthemesvnit.sty` file.

Take a look at the `presentation.tex` and `presentation.pdf` for a sample.
